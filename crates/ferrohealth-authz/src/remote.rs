//! A remote policy decision point (feature `remote`), in the NIST SP 800-162
//! sense of a PDP the PEP consults over the network.
//!
//! Each resource type is bound to one policy of the remote point. For each
//! combination the engine posts `{server}{policy}` with a flat JSON object
//! of the attributes the binding names, read from the combination's resource
//! attributes, then for `kind` from the subject's caller kind (the name
//! `ferrohealth_smart::kind::CallerKind::as_str` gives), and then from the
//! subject's attributes: a `200` permits, any `4xx` denies,
//! and the body of the answer is not read, so the point imposes no policy
//! language. Any other answer, a redirect included, and any failure to reach
//! the point is no decision: an [`AuthzError::Remote`] carrying the status
//! when there was one. Under a client credentials grant the call carries the
//! token of `ferrohealth-smart`, sent once more under a new token on a
//! `401`; a second `401` is no decision either. A point built with
//! [`RemotePdp::with_client`] calls over the product's own HTTP client and
//! tries a call again, under the `retry` table of the endpoint, when the
//! point could not be reached or answered a `5xx`. The wire contract and the
//! retry rule are our own design; no specification governs them.
