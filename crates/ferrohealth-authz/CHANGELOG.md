# Changelog of ferrohealth-authz

All notable changes to `ferrohealth-authz` are documented in this file. It
keeps its own version line, released by the tag
`ferrohealth-authz-vX.Y.Z`; `ferrohealth-smart` keeps its own in
`crates/ferrohealth-smart/CHANGELOG.md`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-11-09

Releases beside `ferrohealth-smart` 0.12.0, whose `resource::Caller` and
`client::cache::TokenSource` this crate carries in its public API (#341).

### Changed

- Requires `ferrohealth-smart` 0.12.0 (caret `0.12.0`) in place of
  `0.11.0`. `request::Subject::of` takes the 0.12.0 `resource::Caller` and
  the remote decision point the 0.12.0 `client::cache::TokenSource`, so a
  product on 0.11 that moves `ferrohealth-smart` to 0.12.0 alone builds two
  copies of it and fails on the type. Upgrade: move `ferrohealth-smart` to
  0.12.0 (its changelog lists what a product changes) and
  `ferrohealth-authz` to 0.6.0 in one change; nothing else this crate
  offers changes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-11-08

Releases beside `ferrohealth-smart` 0.11.0, whose `resource::Caller` and
`client::cache::TokenSource` this crate carries in its public API (#332).

### Changed

- Requires `ferrohealth-smart` 0.11.0 (caret `0.11.0`) in place of
  `0.10.0`. `request::Subject::of` takes the 0.11.0 `resource::Caller` and
  the remote decision point the 0.11.0 `client::cache::TokenSource`, so a
  product on 0.10 that moves `ferrohealth-smart` to 0.11.0 alone builds two
  copies of it and fails on the type. Upgrade: move `ferrohealth-smart` to
  0.11.0 (its changelog lists what a product changes) and
  `ferrohealth-authz` to 0.5.0 in one change; nothing else this crate
  offers changes.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-11-08

A policy reads who stands behind the credential (#262). This release
breaks a Cedar model that declares a subject attribute named `kind`.

### Added

- `request::Subject` carries the caller kind: `Subject::of` reads it from
  `ferrohealth_smart::resource::Caller::kind`, `Subject::with_kind` sets
  it and `Subject::kind` returns it (`None` for a subject built with
  `Subject::new`). The subject's `Debug` names the kind by
  `CallerKind::as_str` alone.

### Changed

- The Cedar principal `User` declares `kind?: String`, holding the name
  `CallerKind::as_str` gives (`person`, `system`, `patient` and the rest
  the audit line records), so a policy reads `principal has kind &&
  principal.kind == "system"`. `cedar::Model` refuses a subject attribute
  named `kind`, as it refuses `roles` and `scopes` (`ModelError::Name`).
  Upgrade: rename a subject attribute `kind` the model declares, and its
  claim mapping, before moving to 0.4.0.
- A remote binding parameter named `kind` carries the subject's caller
  kind, read after the resource attributes and before a subject attribute
  of that name. Upgrade: a remote point that read a product attribute
  named `kind` reads it under another name.
- ferrohealth-authz builds on ferrohealth-smart 0.10.0 (#302), whose
  `resource::Caller` and `kind::CallerKind` its `request::Subject` takes.
  Upgrade: a product moves both crates together, pinning
  `ferrohealth-smart = "=0.10.0"` beside `ferrohealth-authz = "=0.4.0"`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-06

Releases beside `ferrohealth-smart` 0.9.0, whose `resource::Caller` this
crate carries in its public API (#218).

### Changed

- Requires `ferrohealth-smart` 0.9.0 (caret `0.9.0`) in place of `0.8.2`.
  `request::Subject::of` takes the 0.9.0 `ferrohealth_smart::resource::Caller`,
  which carries its `kind::CallerKind`, and `remote::RemotePdp::new` its
  `client::cache::TokenSource`, so a product on 0.8 that moves
  `ferrohealth-smart` to 0.9.0 alone builds two copies of it and fails on
  the type. Upgrade: move `ferrohealth-smart` to 0.9.0 (its changelog lists
  the `[auth]` changes) and `ferrohealth-authz` to 0.3.0 in one change;
  nothing else this crate offers changes.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-27

### Changed

- Requires `ferrohealth-smart` as caret `0.8.2` in place of the exact
  `=0.8.1`, so a product takes a patch of ferrohealth-smart without waiting
  for a release of this crate, the family rule for shared crates.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-27

### Changed

- docs.rs builds every feature, so the `cedar` and `remote` modules are
  documented there (#135).
- It requires `ferrohealth-smart` 0.8.1 (`=0.8.1`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- Takes `ferrohealth-smart` 0.8.0, the line it releases beside.
  `request::Subject::of` takes a `ferrohealth_smart::resource::Caller` and
  `remote::RemotePdp::new` a `ferrohealth_smart::client::cache::TokenSource`,
  so a product moves both crates together; nothing else it calls changes.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- Takes `ferrohealth-smart` 0.7.5, the line it releases beside.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- Takes `ferrohealth-smart` 0.7.4, the line it releases beside.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- Takes `ferrohealth-smart` 0.7.3, the line it releases beside.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- Takes `ferrohealth-smart` 0.7.2, the line it releases beside.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-26

### Changed

- Takes `ferrohealth-smart` 0.7.1, the line it releases beside.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-25

The first release: the policy decision of the FerroHEALTH products, the
NIST SP 800-162 request over the subject `ferrohealth-smart` 0.7.0
authenticates, with the Cedar engine behind `cedar` and the remote decision
point behind `remote`. Products pin `=0.1.0` beside `ferrohealth-smart`
`=0.7.0`.

### Added

- The policy decision of the FerroHEALTH products, moved out of FerroEHR and
  generalised so every product can use it (#103). `request::Subject` is read
  from the caller `ferrohealth-smart` admitted (its subject id, roles, scopes
  and chosen claims); `request::Request` names an action, a resource type,
  resource attributes (a set fans out, every combination must be permitted)
  and context attributes; `request::Decision` carries the policies that made
  it. `engine::PolicyEngine` is the trait every engine implements, and
  `engine::AuthzError` the answer of one that cannot decide, which a product
  never reads as a permit.
- `cedar` (feature `cedar`): the embedded engine over the Cedar policy
  language. The schema is written from the product's `cedar::Model`, the
  operator's policies are validated strictly at load and at every reload, a
  reload that does not validate keeps the set in force, and a policy that
  errors during evaluation makes the evaluation an error instead of being
  skipped.
- `remote` (feature `remote`): a remote policy decision point over HTTP, one
  call per combination with the bound attributes as a flat JSON object,
  `200` a permit, a `4xx` a deny and every other answer no decision,
  authorized with the client credentials token of `ferrohealth-smart`.
