//! The resource-server role: who calls, and what the caller's access token
//! permits.
//!
//! One [`ResourceServer`] validates the access tokens of one authorization
//! server. The issuer and the audiences are configured; the issuer's
//! metadata (RFC 8414 §3, with `OpenID` Connect Discovery 1.0 §4 as the
//! fallback location) names the key set (RFC 7517) every token signature is
//! checked against, or a key set file handed over out of band does. A token
//! is an RFC 7519 JWT, read under the RFC 9068 access token profile unless
//! the deployment says otherwise. A product that trusts several issuers
//! holds them in an [`IssuerSet`]. [`ResourceServer::lazy`] defers the
//! metadata and key set read to the first token, for a product that answers
//! an unreachable issuer with `503` rather than refusing to start. A product
//! that checks a token another
//! way (RFC 7662 introspection, a signed edge assertion) implements
//! [`Verifier`] beside them. A product never forwards a caller's token
//! upstream: an access token names the resource server it is for (RFC 9068
//! §4), and an upstream is reached with the product's own credential
//! ([`crate::client`]).
