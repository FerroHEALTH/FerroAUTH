//! The onward grants: a token a product obtains for another service on
//! behalf of the caller behind a verified token, and the one check every
//! such token passes before it is used.
//!
//! Two grants carry it, chosen by the issuer's profile
//! ([`crate::profile::onward`]): token exchange (RFC 8693 §2.1), the
//! caller's token as `subject_token` with an optional `actor_token` and the
//! target as `resource` (RFC 8707 §2) or `audience`, and the JWT bearer
//! grant (RFC 7523 §2.1), the caller's token as `assertion` with `scope`
//! naming the target. The client authenticates as configured in its
//! [`ClientCredentials`](crate::client::ClientCredentials), `private_key_jwt`
//! (RFC 7523 §2.2) the form RFC 9700 §2.5 recommends.
//!
//! The issued token is decoded and refused unless its issuer is the one
//! asked, its `aud` lies inside the target's audiences, its `exp` is within
//! the issuer's `max_onward_lifetime` of its `iat`, it carries the
//! profile's `expect`, it names the requesting client as its actor, and it
//! names the caller's person: by the profile's `person_equality` claims on
//! a `persons` issuer, by the attested `person_mapping` of its
//! `[[auth.federation]]` table on a `federation` issuer. A failed exchange
//! is a typed error carrying the upstream status, and the client never
//! falls back to its own credentials. The rules beyond the two RFCs are our
//! own design.
