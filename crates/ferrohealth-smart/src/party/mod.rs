//! The party a person's login belongs to: one lookup through a source the
//! product supplies, with one match rule, one duplicate rule and one
//! stable-claim rule, and one typed [`Outcome`].
//!
//! A `Person`, `Delegated` or `Representative` caller of a `persons` issuer
//! that has an `[[auth.party]]` table ([`PartySection`]) is looked up by the
//! value of its issuer profile's `person_key` (OpenID Connect Core 1.0 §5.7:
//! `email`, `phone_number`, `preferred_username` and `name` are never a
//! key), put in the canonical form its `identifier_type` declares, against
//! the identifiers of the table's `identifier_issuer` in the product's
//! [`PartySource`]. A Basic user is looked up by the key the product maps it
//! to, through the same path. A representative is looked up by their own
//! login, never by the subject they represent. `Patient`, `System`,
//! `ExternalPerson` and `ExternalOrganisation` callers, and a guest the
//! table does not admit, are never looked up: a `federation` token's `sub`
//! names a user in another issuer's namespace.
//!
//! The library calls the source on every request and holds no cache. Two
//! parties carrying one login are [`Outcome::Ambiguous`], never resolved to
//! either, and a failing source is a [`SourceError`], never an
//! [`Outcome::Unbound`]. What each outcome means is the product's to decide.
//! No specification governs resolving a login to a party: our own design.
//!
